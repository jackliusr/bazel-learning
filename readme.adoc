# Practice: Beginning Bazel
[] web

Today is 2021-12-26. In the past two days, I tried to setup bazel for one microservice projects 
hosted in gitlab with subgroups following reading documentations on https://docs.bazel.build/[bazel]. The hard work don't bore any fruit. I don't want to give up, So I start to learn it following a book's guide. This way maybe is more approachable. 

Here is my practices following the book "Beginning Bazel". Bazel changes very fast as it has ~9 month release cycle. You don't want to waste your time on old things, me neither. my practice is based on Bazel 4.2.2

Most of my practices are similar to "Beginning Bazel", however several one are quite different and I list them afterwards. 

## Chapter 06

It always give "protoc-gen-go failed :: The import path must contain at least one forward slash ('/') character." error. or no dependencies error.  

go_proto_library in new version have broke compatibilities and made importpath attribute mandatory.

The two errors interwingled together and make it hard to resolve.

Changes I made to resovle the issues:app-name:
- go mod init chapter_06
- option go_package="chapter_06/transmission_object";
- import "chapter_06/transmission_object"

```
