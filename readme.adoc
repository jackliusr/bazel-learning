Today is 2021-12-26. In the past two days, I tried to setup bazel for one microservice projects hosted in gitlab with subgroups following reading documentations on https://docs.bazel.build/[bazel]. The hard work don't bore any fruit. I don't want to give up, So I start to learn it following a book's guide. This way maybe is more approachable. 

Here is my practices following the book "Beginning Bazel". Bazel changes very fast as it has ~9 month release cycle. You don't want to waste your time on old things, So do I. my practice is based on Bazel 4.2.2

```
Build label: 4.2.2
